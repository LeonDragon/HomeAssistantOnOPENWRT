It is a installation script for HomeAssistant.  

Use command `sh install.sh` to start the installation.  
After that, use command `hass` to start the HomeAssistant. Note that the first start will download and install some dependent python module.
It may take 20~30 minutes. Network connection problem will cause start failure. While don't worry, retry `hass` usually works.
